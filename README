This is project is partly for my own expirementation, and partly as a dmoe for NoSQL approaches to persistence.

I will be updating notes periodically, including usefil information for each database setup. 

Most of what you need is available in the codebase. However, there are a couple setup steps. You will need a sqlexpress instance running.  The connection string is available in BlogSQL\web.config.  There are batch files to start each of the NoSQL servers, which don't require any additional install.  Any specific instructions for each will be noted below.

::Recommendations::
- Use tests even though this demo doesn't
- Use something other than Webforms, like Spark or Monorail.
- Consider your goal and environment before chosing SQL or NoSQL or both

::SQL Server::

::MongoDB::

::RavenDB::
RavenDB requires indexes in order to query data. You can create queries using the Web UI or, as this demo does, using code.
